# SignToSpeech 🔊

SignToSpeech is an Android application designed to convert hand signs into text and speech using computer vision techniques.  
The app aims to help bridge the communication gap between hearing-impaired users and others by translating sign language gestures into audible speech in real time.

## 📌 Project Description

The application uses the smartphone camera to capture live video frames and processes them using **OpenCV**.  
Hand gestures are detected and analyzed, converted into meaningful text, and finally spoken out using Android's **TextToSpeech (TTS)** engine.

This project works completely **offline** and performs all processing **on-device**, without the need for any backend server.
