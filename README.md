# SignToSpeech Android Application

SignToSpeech is an Android application designed to convert hand signs into text and speech using computer vision techniques.
The application helps bridge the communication gap by translating sign language gestures into understandable output.

---

## Project Description

The application uses the smartphone camera to capture live video frames and processes them using OpenCV.
Hand gestures are detected and analyzed, converted into meaningful text, and then spoken using Android TextToSpeech.

The project works completely offline and performs all processing on the device without using any backend server.
